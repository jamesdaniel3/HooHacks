# HooHacks
This is our HooHacks repo!
 
The goal of this project is to develop a google extension that allows the user to upload their
syllabi and then download an excel spreadsheet containing all of their assignments for the 
semester, listed in chronological order and color coded by class. 

Some of the issues with this that have yet to be fixed are:
- It does not work in languages other than English
- It still struggles with many syllabi
